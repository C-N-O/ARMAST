# ARMAST

An Arrays, Math, and String methods App

# Description

As a developer, sometimes I come across certain scenarios where I am not sure what Array, String, or Math method to use to solve a particular problem, this App was built to solve that problem. This App serves as a hub for Array, String, and Math methods. When a particular method name is clicked, there is a popup that shows the name of the method, its description/function, and return value.

# NOTE:

This App is still a work in progress. Some methods are still being added and not all the modal work

The App is available to view at:
